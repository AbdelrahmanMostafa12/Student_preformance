This project aims to analyze the performance of students in a school based on their demographic and academic data.

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project contains information about 1,000 students, including:

- **gender:** the student's gender (male or female)
- **race/ethnicity:** the student's race/ethnicity (group A, B, C, D, or E)
- **parental level of education:** the highest level of education attained by the student's parents (some high school, high school, some college, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or master's degree)
- **lunch:** whether or not the student received free or reduced-price lunch (yes or no)
- **test preparation course:** whether or not the student completed a test preparation course (completed or none)
- **math score:** the student's score on a math exam (out of 100)
- **reading score:** the student's score on a reading exam (out of 100)
- **writing score:** the student's score on a writing exam (out of 100)

## Analysis

The data was analyzed using Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the data and to identify any patterns or relationships.

Some of the questions that were answered through the analysis are:

- How does parental level of education affect student performance?
- Is there a relationship between test preparation course and student performance?
- How does lunch affect student performance?
- Is there a difference in performance between male and female students?
- How does race/ethnicity affect student performance?

The analysis was presented through various visualizations such as histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots.

## Conclusion

From the analysis, it was found that there is a significant relationship between parental level of education and student performance. Students whose parents have a higher level of education tend to perform better in exams. Test preparation courses also have a positive impact on student performance.

Moreover, students who receive free or reduced-price lunch tend to perform worse than those who do not receive it. Female students tend to perform better than male students in reading and writing exams, while male students tend to perform better in math exams.

Finally, race/ethnicity also plays a role in student performance, with students from group E (highest level) performing better than those from groups A, B, C, and D.

## Future Work

Further analysis could be done to identify other factors that affect student performance. Additionally, predictive modeling could be applied to predict a student's performance based on their demographic and academic data.
